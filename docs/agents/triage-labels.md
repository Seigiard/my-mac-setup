# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This repository stores those roles as issue tags because its local tracker has no native labels.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Tag in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`     | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`       | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`  | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`  | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`          | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role, use the corresponding tag from this table. Preserve unrelated tags when changing roles because `scripts/issues edit --tag` replaces the complete tag list.
